# Welcome!

I'm Andres Perez, an incoming freshman at the University of Notre Dame, studying engineering! While I am still figuring out which path to pursue within the field, I am interested in learning more about robotics, electronics, and programming.

*My journey begins here on GitHub as I explore my interests and find my way.*
